The program has no way to know the intention of the humans that made
the scripts, so it's always advisable to manually check all generated
files to make sure everything is declared as it should.

Take note the program assumes this script exists in some subfolder
to the folder where `skyrimPlatform.ts` is found, otherwise you'll get
"Cannot find module..." type of errors.

If you want to have this script in some other place, just change the
relative path of each `import`.
